-- Developed a mini project (a basic shopping cart) using Redux Toolkit and React
-- Used a local json server to store dummy data.
-- Created two stores 1st for Products, 2nd for cart
-- handled API requests (get, post, delete) using Async Thunk for both Products and Cart
-- In Reactjs created two components
-- 1st component fetches all the products from products store using useSelector hook provided by react-redux package. We can also add products to cart using useDispatch hook
-- 2nd component fetches all products from cart, we can also delete items from cart.
